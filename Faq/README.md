## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. **Add FAQ Tab to Product Pages**: The module listens for the `catalog_product_view` layout and adds a new **FAQ** block to the product detail page after the reviews section.
2. **Display FAQ Data**: The FAQ block pulls data from the `Faq.php` block class and displays it on the product page.
3. **Customizable FAQ Content**: You can modify the FAQ content by editing the `getFaqData()` method inside `Faq.php`. This allows you to easily add or remove questions and answers as needed.

### üí° Example:

- **Question**: What is the warranty period?
- **Answer**: The warranty period is 1 year.

## üöÄ Updated Version (Pro Version)

### Overview of the Pro Version

The **Pro Version** of the **Priyanshu_Faq** module adds advanced functionality for managing FAQs dynamically based on the **first letter of the product name**. This feature allows you to display different FAQs tailored to each product, based on the starting letter of the product's name. This enables a more organized and relevant FAQ section for users, especially for products with large amounts of FAQ data.

### Key Features of the Pro Version:
- **Dynamic FAQ Display**: FAQ questions and answers are displayed based on the first letter of the product‚Äôs name (e.g., if the product starts with 'A', FAQs specific to that letter will be shown).
- **Predefined FAQ Categories**: A set of predefined FAQs for each letter of the alphabet (e.g., 'A', 'B', 'C', etc.) along with customizable questions and answers.
- **Customizable FAQ Content**: Easily manage and modify FAQ content for each product based on its starting letter.
- **Improved User Experience**: Tailors FAQs to specific products, making the content more relevant for the customer.

### Example:

For a product starting with the letter **'A'**, it will display FAQs like:
- **What are the common applications of [Product name]?**
- **How do I choose the right [Product name] for my project?**
- **Are [Product name] available in different sizes?**

For a product starting with the letter **'B'**, it will display FAQs like:
- **What are the key features of [Product name]?**
- **Is [Product name] available?**
- **What maintenance is required for [Product name]?**

You can easily add more questions for each letter or modify the existing ones.

This version is perfect for stores with a wide variety of products, each requiring detailed and specific FAQ content.


## üîß Customization

You can easily customize the FAQ data or the styling by editing the following files:

### 1. Add or Remove FAQ Questions

- Open the file `app/code/Priyanshu/Faq/Block/Faq.php`.
- Modify the `getFaqData()` function to add new questions or remove old ones:

  ```php
  public function getFaqData()
  {
      return [
          ['question' => 'What is the warranty period?', 'answer' => 'The warranty period is 1 year.'],
          ['question' => 'Can I return this product?', 'answer' => 'Yes, you can return within 30 days of purchase.'],
          ['question' => 'Is this product available in different colors?', 'answer' => 'Yes, we have multiple colors available.']
      ];
  }
  ```

- Add a new question:
  
  ```php
  ['question' => 'Is free shipping available?', 'answer' => 'Yes, free shipping is available on orders over $50.']
  ```

- Remove an existing question by deleting the corresponding array item.

### 2. Modify the FAQ Section Layout

If you want to change where the FAQ tab appears or modify its layout:
- Open the file `app/code/Priyanshu/Faq/view/frontend/layout/catalog_product_view.xml`.
- Update the `<block>` tag to change the location or appearance of the FAQ section.

For example, to move it to a different section of the page:
  
```xml
<referenceContainer name="product.info.additional">
    <block class="Priyanshu\Faq\Block\Faq" name="product.faq.tab" template="Priyanshu_Faq::product/view/faq.phtml" />
</referenceContainer>
```

### 3. Modify the FAQ Section Styling

To change the look and feel of the FAQ section:

- Open the file `app/code/Priyanshu/Faq/view/frontend/web/css/faq.css`.
- Modify the CSS properties to adjust the design of the FAQ section (e.g., change border color, font size, or spacing).

For example, to change the header color:

```css
.faq-section h2 {
    color: #333;
}
```
